# skyrim

Moved from a Clojure project to a Go project. This is my attempt to a question only one person has asked, me.

What is the fewest number of potions that need to be created to discover all the effects for all the ingredients in the game.

There are other interesting questions that stem from this original gameplay question but initially I want to develope a method/theory behind the base case.
